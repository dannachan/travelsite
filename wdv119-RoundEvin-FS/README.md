Hello my name is Evin. I am a student attending Full Sail University from Ohio, USA. The purpose of this repository is to practice development using version control. This work will help me begin to build a portfolio of skills and accomplishment that can be shared in the future.

## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Week 1

⚙️ Overview - This week, I began my first experience with mock work in development and, am beginning to understand the work flow and process of what will be expected in the position.
<br>
🌵 Challenges - There are alot of new things to learn and memorize that are crucial in setting up the foundation for how my future jobs will go. It is hard to remember everything.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I feel like I'm taking a real big step this class towards being a web developer. It's different with the previous classes because, for the most part, I already knew it all. Javascript I didn't know, but the way we get to use it is still very much in the sandbox. Using git and github and using the keywords Agile and Scrum really make everything feel more tangible. I feel like I'm actually going to accomplish this.
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - 

### Week 2

⚙️ Overview - This week, I worked on building my first solo mockups for the other web pages as well as building the website ontop of the bones I built last week for the home page.
<br>
🌵 Challenges - The workload is difficult and all fairly new to me. It's alot what with me being so new to everything and having to sit down for a long period of time. It's good practice for the workforce for sure, but it feels like such a dramatic difference between prior classes and this. I'm also struggling with the building of the website itself. I have tools and a sense of logic on how it should be able to be built, but coding is not as flexable as I seem to always expect it to be. I need to focus on getting more tools in my belt before I can try to take off because intuition is not serving me here. It's a struggle I have with all sciences.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I got through some very difficult work this week and I'm satisfied with what I've built thus far. I could easily rush through and make a real hackjob of things, but that wouldn't serve me at all. This time is for learning, so I must learn.
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - I need to finish my mockups for the final pages and get the rest of the home page built and completed so I can move onto the next set of steps.

### Week 3

⚙️ Overview - This week, I worked on catching up and becoming current with the work required of me, building everything and completing documentation.
<br>
🌵 Challenges - The ever present problem is work time vs. school time availability as well as hands on learning for what works and what doesn't.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I built everything I needed to for this week and still simplified everything in the way I feel shows exactly what it's supposed to be in a functional way that fits the rest of the theme.
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - I will need to finish my last two pages and refine my code.

### Week 4

⚙️ Overview - This week, I focused on accomplishing what I can and accepting what I can't.
<br>
🌵 Challenges - I had to deal with the unfortunate reality that my ambitions are beyond my skillset and time alotment. The things I want to accomplish and how I want to accomplish them aren't possible and it's a very hard pill to swallow. It often rends me still where I end up not doing anything at all.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I've walked over hurdles this week I didn't think I'd be able to, and have been so stressed that I wouldn't be able to finish anything. But I did. 
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - I'll need to prepare myself for the next class and continue my best.
