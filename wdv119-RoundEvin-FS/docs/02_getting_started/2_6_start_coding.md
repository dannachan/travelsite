# Getting Started with Coding!

## /.git

Before we continue, it's important to understand how git keeps track of changes. When a repository is cloned down from GitHub, it contains an invisible **.git** folder. This folder is used to track all changes inside of your local repository. It's like having a mini-database running that keeps track of every change made inside of the cloned down repository.

## Tracking

Let's have a look at the invisible .git folder. To see any invisible files and folders within a folder, make sure the finder window is active then hit SHIFT + CMD + . (period) on your keyboard.

The invisible .git folder indicates that git is being used behind the scenes to track changes to this folder. We can refer to this folder as the "cloned down local repository".

> It's a best practice to leave invisibility turned off. In this case, you are only temporarily turning on invisibility to confirm and see that there is actually an invisible folder. That's where git keeps track of changes behind the scenes!

## Using Git

To get started, let's move your portfolio files from the Interfaces & Usability course inside your new repo folder
<br>

### Add Files to Repository

Drag your portfolio folder inside of your repository's üìÅ dev folder. Since the entire cloned down repository already has version control enabled (thanks to the invisible .git folder running behind the scenes), there is no need to also initialize your new coding project with version control.

# Begin Development
üéâ Congratulations on setting up version control and adding your past work to the cloned down class repository! As you work on code, remember to use version control to track changes automatically.

Here are the basic steps...

1. Work on project
2. Add changes: `git add <fileName>` or `git add .`
3. Commit changes: `git commit -m "brief update message here"`
4. Push changes `git push`

<br>

## Best Practice

**It's best practice to add and commit often.** It's recommended to set a timer to remind you to do this every now and then. Each time you make a change, use git to add the change, make a commit, and then push changes to your repository. In this way you can practice and get used to using the basics of version control.

Feel free to explore other features of version control as you become comfortable with git.

In the meantime...
